Link to Website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-introduction-to-software-engineering/

The above website is a great resource for software engineering. It contains not only detailed knowledge about the subject, but also provides overview of it. Also we can link ourselves to everything about programming, so it is a great website in my opinion to go to when I have trouble with a cs problem.

> I totally get what you're saying about the website. I looked at the article on **GeeksforGeeks**, and it's really good at explaining what software engineering is all about. They talk about the main ideas, what software does, and the difference between a program and a whole software product. They also list the good and not-so-good parts of software engineering, which is super helpful. Plus, they have some questions at the end which is cool for testing what you learned. I can see why you like using it when you're stuck on computer stuff!
